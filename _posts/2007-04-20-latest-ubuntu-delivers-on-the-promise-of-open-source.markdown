_**While millions consider whether to pay for Vista, the Ubuntu project releases its secure, high performance, free desktop and server editions.**_

LONDON, April 16, 2007 â€“ For users wanting a secure, feature rich alternative to Microsoft Windows, Canonical Ltd., the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, announced today the Thursday release of Ubuntu version 7.04.

Ubuntu is the award-winning [Linux distribution for the desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntudesktop704), laptop, thin client and [server](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntuserver704) which brings together the best of open source software every 6 months. Ubuntu 7.04 desktop edition includes a ground-breaking Windows migration assistant, excellent wireless networking support and improved multimedia support.

[Ubuntu 7.04 server edition](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntuserver704) adds support for hardware facilities that speed up the use of virtual machines as well as other improved hardware support, making it an excellent choice as a web, database, file and print server, the fastest growing area of Linux server use. Ubuntu's already outstanding support for thin clients is boosted with advanced print and sound support.

"In the coming months, many individuals and businesses will be making the decision to upgrade their existing computer systems and their operating systems," said Jane Silber, director of Operations, Canonical Ltd. "With added features to both the desktop and server editions, Ubuntu 7.04 is the most user-friendly version to date and is ideally suited to anyone who wants to make the switch to Linux and join the community of Ubuntu users. In fact, with this version of Ubuntu, it is easier than ever to move away from proprietary platforms."

At the same time as Ubuntu, the project also will release new versions of [Kubuntu and Edubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntuflavours704), specialized versions of Ubuntu which include the KDE desktop environment and educational applications, respectively.

Ubuntu 7.04 will be maintained for 18 months on both the desktop and on the server, and additional free support is available from the thriving Ubuntu community.
