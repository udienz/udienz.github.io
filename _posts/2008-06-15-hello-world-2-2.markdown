here is the log:


<blockquote>12:32	Belutz	for all his contributions for ubuntu-id I could give him +1
12:32	lifeless	so, any more questions to ask ?
12:32	lifeless	(I have none)
12:32	elkbuntu	nor i. +1
12:33	persia	+1 from me, although Iâ€™d like to see more of the various projects more integrated with Ubuntu
12:33	amachu__	neither too.. thats fair enough +1
12:33	amachu__	neither me too..
* elkbuntu agrees with persia
12:33	amachu__	zakame: there?
* udienz- still waiting
12:34	lifeless	+1
12:35 lifeless persia: I agree re the projects, but I think that that is largely orthogonal; he is contributing both directly and indirectly
12:35	udienz-	lifeless: thanksâ€¦
12:36 Belutz the problem in our country is that we still focus in gathering more FOSS users than FOSS developers, how can they be a developer if they doesnâ€™t use it
12:36	zakame	+1 on the translation works, keep it up
12:36 persia lifeless: Entirely. I believe udienz- deserves membership based on the strength of LoCo work and translations. Iâ€™d still like to see this membership used to help transition ubuntume and BlankOn into in-repo derivatives.
12:36	amachu__	persia: i too would stress on that, overall Ok
* Belutz congrats udienz-
12:37	udienz-	hihihi
* RameTux congrats udienz-
12:37	amachu__	udienz-: Welcome
