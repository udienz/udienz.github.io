Last month ago i've been submitted my CV at [Data Utama Internet Sevices Provider](http://www.datautama.net.id), and this week my Datautama approved as his staff. So i must moved from Surabaya to Jakarta soon. I've pleased with this company because this company very supported FOSS movement with providing free colo to FOSS stuff.

And i'll working as linux engineering, well that was amazing because this position is very difficult and rare :). At least i want to say thank you for all my friends who want providing informations and support for my new jobs especially ashadebi, mas nurdin, etc
