Hi readers,

Just want to let you know that i have created a docker container for puppet syntax checker. You can found the container at [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/udienz/puppet-lint/), and if you interest to use this container please follow below instructions:




    
  1. Assumed if you have own puppet module (or you can for popular modules, let say puppetlabs-apt)

    
  2. Your own module located in ~/puppet/module and you are now in there



To check your module just type below in your terminal


    
    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/code udienz/puppet-lint



You may see te output like below:


    
    
    Don't run Bundler as root. Bundler can ask for sudo if it is needed, and
    installing your bundle as root will break this application for all non-root
    users on this machine.
